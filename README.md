Two-factor authentication

## Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)
* [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node)

## Installation
Install project packages
```
npm install
```
## Build
To build the project (generate js files) and launch a localhost by running the js files
```
npm run build
npm start
```
OR you can run the code without generating js files (runs nodemon for `src/app.ts`)
```
npm run dev
```
You can then open your browser run the localhost on port 5000
```localhost:5000```
